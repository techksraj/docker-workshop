Inner Joins

1) Implicit INNER JOIN

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' | ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' | ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips t,
    zones zpu,
    zones zdo
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    AND t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

2) Explicit INNER JOIN

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' | ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' | ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips t
JOIN
-- or INNER JOIN but it's less used, when writing JOIN, postgreSQL understands implicitly that we want to use an INNER JOIN
    zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN
    zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

Data Quality Checks
3) Checking for NULL Location IDs

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    "PULocationID",
    "DOLocationID"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE
    "PULocationID" IS NULL
    OR "DOLocationID" IS NULL
LIMIT 100;
4) Checking for Location IDs NOT IN Zones Table
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    "PULocationID",
    "DOLocationID"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
WHERE
    "DOLocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" from zones)
    OR "PULocationID" NOT IN (SELECT "LocationID" from zones)
LIMIT 100;

5) LEFT, RIGHT, and OUTER JOINS
Using LEFT, RIGHT, and OUTER JOINS when some Location IDs are not in either Tables:

DELETE FROM zones WHERE "LocationID" = 142;

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' | ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' | ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips t
LEFT JOIN
    zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN
    zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' | ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' | ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips t
RIGHT JOIN
    zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN
    zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;

SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    total_amount,
    CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' | ', zpu."Zone") AS "pickup_loc",
    CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' | ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips t
OUTER JOIN
    zones zpu ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
JOIN
    zones zdo ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
GROUP BY

6) Calculate Number of Trips Per Day
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
LIMIT 100;
ORDER BY
Ordering by Day
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
    COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY
    "day" ASC
LIMIT 100;

7) Ordering by Count
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
    COUNT(1) AS "count"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY
    "count" DESC
LIMIT 100;

8) Other Aggregations
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
    COUNT(1) AS "count",
    MAX(total_amount) AS "total_amount",
    MAX(passenger_count) AS "passenger_count"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY
    "count" DESC
LIMIT 100;

9) Grouping by Multiple Fields
SELECT
    CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) AS "day",
    "DOLocationID",
    COUNT(1) AS "count",
    MAX(total_amount) AS "total_amount",
    MAX(passenger_count) AS "passenger_count"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_trips
GROUP BY
    1, 2
ORDER BY
    "day" ASC,
    "DOLocationID" ASC
LIMIT 100;
